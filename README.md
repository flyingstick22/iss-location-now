The International Space Station Location Web App

The aim of this code was to test how easy it is to create web app by using Streamlit (https://streamlit.io). The App uses simple API calls to track ISS position and astronauts on board. The astronaut animation is so called "Lottiefile". 

This web app was deployed by using Heroku: https://isslocationnow.herokuapp.com
