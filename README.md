# ISS-location-now
The International Space Station (ISS) Location Web App

The aim of this python code was to test how easy it is to create web app by using Streamlit (https://streamlit.io). The App uses simple API calls to track ISS position and astronauts on board. The astronaut animation is so called "Lottiefile". 

This web app was deployed by using Heroku: https://isslocationnow.herokuapp.com
