# ISS-location-now
The International Space Station (ISS) Location Web App

The aim of this python code was to test how easy it is to create web app using Streamlit (https://streamlit.io). The app uses simple API calls to track ISS position and astronauts on board. The astronaut animation is so called "Lottiefile" (https://lottiefiles.com)

This web app was deployed using Heroku: https://isslocationnow.herokuapp.com (takes about 30 s. to load).
