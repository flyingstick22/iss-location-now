# ISS-location-now
The International Space Station (ISS) Location Web App

The aim of this python code was to test how easy it is to create web app by using Streamlit (https://streamlit.io). The App uses simple API calls to track ISS position and astronauts on board. The astronaut animation is so called "Lottiefile" from https://lottiefiles.com

This web app was deployed by using Heroku: https://isslocationnow.herokuapp.com [works until 28.11.2022](https://help.heroku.com/RSBRUH58/removal-of-heroku-free-product-plans-faq))
